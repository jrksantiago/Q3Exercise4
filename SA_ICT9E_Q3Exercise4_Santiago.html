		It was a bright and sunny day it was my 2nd day in being in Hongkong it was the middle of summer vacation and it was very hot I was 8 years old and it was my first time to go outside of the country and we just had a big heavy breakfast it was just me, my brother, and my parents.  We decided to go to disneyland on bus we went on was a tour bus and I didn't know that back then so before we went to disney land we went sight seeing and to some places that Hongkong has to offer us like malls and historical places and finally we were able to reach disney land.
